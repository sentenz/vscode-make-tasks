## 1. Details

### 1.1. Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
  > Visual Studio Code (>=1.133) is required to run the extension.

### 1.2. Usage

1. Insights and Details

    - Specification
      > The [Make Tasks Specification](docs/make-tasks-specification.md) is the normative reference for annotation syntax and externally observable behavior.

    - Activity Bar
      > Dedicated Makefile icon and target explorer in the Activity Bar.

    - Explorer
      > Target grouping by workspace, Makefile, and category when necessary.

    - Execution
      > Target execution as native VS Code tasks from the explorer.

    - Quick Pick
      > Keyboard-driven target selection and execution.

    - Navigation
      > Direct navigation to target definitions.

    - Workspace
      > Multi-root workspace and multiple-Makefile support.

    - Auto-refresh
      > Automatic target refresh after matching Makefile changes when `makefileTasks.autoRefresh` is enabled.

    - Configuration
      > Configurable Make command, discovery globs, exclusions, sorting, click behavior, and automatic refresh.

2. Usage and Instructions

    - [Tasks](docs/make-tasks-specification.md#151-tasks)
      > The extension discovers documented Makefile targets and presents them as VS Code tasks. A target is discoverable when it has a non-empty preceding or inline `##` description. The extension ignores undocumented targets, helper rules, pattern rules, variable assignments, and unsupported target names.

      ```make
      ## Single-line description for the build task
      build:
      	go build ./...
      .PHONY: build
      ```

      ```make
      test: ## Inline description for the test task
      	go test ./...
      .PHONY: test
      ```

    - [Categorization](docs/make-tasks-specification.md#152-category)
      > Organize tasks with canonical section comments. The extension groups tasks by category in the Activity Bar explorer and places uncategorized tasks under **Uncategorized**.

      ```make
      # ─── Skills Manager ────────────────────────────────────────────────────

      skills-agent-add: ## Provision Agent Skills
      	skills add ./skills

      skills-agent-update: ## Update Agent Skills
      	skills update ./skills

      # --- Dependencies ------------------------------------------------------

      dependency-update: ## Update project dependencies
      	renovate --platform=local

      # === Test ==============================================================

      test: ## Run the test suite
      	go test ./...
      ```

    - [Input Metadata](docs/make-tasks-specification.md#153-inputs)
      > Document expected positional arguments or Make variable assignments with optional `# Usage:` metadata. Usage metadata is descriptive and does not validate or supply runtime arguments.

      ```make
      # Usage: make deploy ENV=<name> [VERSION=<version>]
      #
      deploy: ## Deploy the application
      	./scripts/deploy --env "$(ENV)" --version "$(VERSION)"
      .PHONY: deploy
      ```

    - [Invocation](docs/make-tasks-specification.md#133-input-processing-and-execution)
      > Run targets with positional arguments or Make variable assignments through **Run Target with Arguments** or `makefileTarget` task definitions.

      ```make
      # Usage: make build [MODE=<mode>]
      #
      build: ## Build the application
      	go build -tags "$(MODE)" ./...
      .PHONY: build
      ```

### 1.3. MCP Server

The optional stdio MCP server exposes the extension's Makefile parser to AI agents without executing Make. Its `list_make_targets` tool returns documented targets, descriptions, categories, usage metadata, and zero-based source lines.

```bash
npm install
npm run mcp:start
```

The server reads workspace-relative Makefile paths from the current directory. Set `MAKE_TASKS_MCP_ROOT` to use another workspace root. Requests that resolve outside that root are rejected.

Example tool input:

```json
{
  "makefile": "Makefile"
}
```

Build and exercise the server with MCP Inspector:

```bash
npm run mcp:inspect
```

The server uses stdout exclusively for MCP messages and writes its readiness message to stderr.
