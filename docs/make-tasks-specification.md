# Make Tasks Specification

The Make Tasks Specification defines the Makefile annotations and task behavior supported by the [Make Tasks](../README.md) extension for the [Visual Studio Code task system](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/tasks). It establishes a compact contract for documented-target discovery, descriptions, categories, inputs, task resolution, execution, and workspace presentation.

The specification covers only the extension's recognized annotation subset. [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) remains authoritative for Makefile syntax, dependency evaluation, recipes, and execution semantics.

## 1. Specification

The specification defines the supported annotation syntax, discovery and task behavior, configuration controls, and representative examples for Make Tasks.

### 1.1. Scope

Make Tasks exposes documented Makefile targets through an Activity Bar explorer, extension commands, and the Visual Studio Code task system. This specification defines the annotation and integration behavior required for those interfaces; it does not define general Makefile parsing.

#### 1.1.1. Conformance

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, and **MAY** are interpreted according to IETF [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) and [RFC 8174](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174) when they appear in uppercase.

A conforming implementation satisfies every applicable normative statement in this document. Changes to recognized annotation syntax or externally observable task behavior SHOULD update this specification and the corresponding regression tests in the same change.

#### 1.1.2. Feature Model

The feature model separates source annotations from runtime input.

- Target
  > A concrete Make rule name that identifies a task.

- Description
  > Required source metadata that makes a supported target discoverable.

- Category
  > Optional persistent source metadata that groups subsequent documented targets and may map them to a built-in Visual Studio Code task group.

- Usage Metadata
  > Optional source metadata that describes the positional goals or Make variable assignments accepted after a target.

- Runtime Argument
  > An ordered value supplied through an extension command or a `makefileTarget` task definition and passed to Make after the target name.

### 1.2. Annotation Syntax

Annotations are line-oriented comments associated with concrete Make rules. Description and usage annotations are pending metadata that apply only to the next supported rule. Category metadata remains active until another valid category header replaces it.

A line beginning with a tab is recipe content and MUST NOT be interpreted as an annotation or target. Otherwise, optional horizontal whitespace MAY precede usage and category annotations; description annotations permit leading spaces.

#### 1.2.1. Target Rules

A discovered target name MUST match:

```plaintext
[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_.-]*
```

A supported rule MUST begin at the first character of a line, contain one or more valid target names separated by spaces or tabs, and use `:` or `::` as the rule separator. Prerequisites MAY follow the separator.

Pattern rules, assignments, recipes, unsupported target names, and undocumented rules MUST NOT produce discovered targets.

#### 1.2.2. Descriptions

A supported target MUST have a non-empty preceding or inline description.

- Preceding Description
  > A preceding description begins with `##` after optional leading spaces and applies to the immediately following supported rule.

- Inline Description
  > An inline description uses `## <description>` in the rule remainder. It MAY follow prerequisites and takes precedence over a pending preceding description.

- Consecutive Description
  > Consecutive non-empty preceding description lines are joined with one space. An empty `##` line contributes no text and does not terminate the description block.

- Adjacency
  > A blank line, ordinary comment, assignment, unsupported construct, category header, or recipe line clears pending description and usage metadata.

- Multiple Targets
  > A supported rule containing multiple target names produces one discovered target per name. Each target receives the same description and active category.

#### 1.2.3. Categories

A category header has the following abstract form:

```plaintext
<optional-horizontal-whitespace>#<whitespace><separator-run><whitespace><category>(<whitespace><trailing-separator-run>)?
```

The leading separator run MUST contain one Unicode punctuation or symbol character repeated at least three times. The category name MUST be non-empty. A trailing separator run, when present, MUST use the same character as the leading run and MUST be preceded by whitespace.

A valid category applies to subsequent documented targets until another valid category header is encountered. Unrelated Makefile constructs do not clear the active category. A category header clears pending description and usage metadata.

#### 1.2.4. Inputs

Input support consists of descriptive usage metadata and ordered runtime arguments.

Usage metadata MAY precede a documented target in the following form:

```plaintext
# Usage: make <target> <usage-suffix>
```

`Usage` and `make` are matched case-insensitively. The metadata target name is matched to a discovered target case-sensitively.

Spacer comments containing only `#` and optional horizontal whitespace MAY occur between the usage line and the description. A non-empty, trimmed usage suffix is retained as descriptive text. An empty or mismatched usage annotation does not suppress an otherwise valid documented target. For a rule containing multiple targets, usage metadata applies only to the target whose name matches the annotation.

Usage metadata MUST NOT validate, type, transform, or supply runtime arguments. Runtime arguments originate from **Run Target with Arguments** or the optional `args` array in a `makefileTarget` task definition.

### 1.3. Discovery and Task Behavior

Discovery converts supported annotations and rules into workspace-scoped target records. Task integration converts those records into Visual Studio Code tasks without evaluating Make variables, includes, conditionals, implicit rules, or generated targets.

#### 1.3.1. Discovery

Makefiles MUST be discovered independently within each workspace folder using the configured include globs and exclusion glob. Files containing no documented targets MUST be omitted.

Each discovered target MUST retain its name, description, workspace folder, workspace-relative Makefile path, and source line. Category and usage metadata MUST be retained when present.

Within one Makefile, the first discovered definition of a target name MUST be retained and later duplicate definitions MUST be ignored. The same target name in different Makefiles remains distinct.

#### 1.3.2. Task Definition and Resolution

Discovered targets MUST be available through the `makefileTarget` task type.

| Property   | Required | Description                                                                      |
| ---------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`     | Yes      | Literal task type `makefileTarget`.                                              |
| `target`   | Yes      | Target name to execute.                                                          |
| `makefile` | No       | Workspace-relative Makefile path used to disambiguate the target.                |
| `args`     | No       | Ordered positional goals or Make variable assignments appended after the target. |

When `makefile` is present, task resolution MUST match the target name and workspace-relative Makefile path. When the task has a workspace-folder scope, resolution MUST also match that folder.

When `makefile` is absent, task resolution MUST use the first discovered target with the same name in the applicable workspace scope. An explicit `makefile` value SHOULD be used when the same target name occurs in more than one discovered Makefile.

#### 1.3.3. Input Processing and Execution

A resolved task MUST execute the configured Make command with this argument order:

```plaintext
<make-command> -f <makefile-name> <target> [arguments...]
```

The working directory MUST be the directory containing the selected Makefile. Arguments declared in `tasks.json` are appended in array order.

Text entered through **Run Target with Arguments** is tokenized without applying shell grammar. Whitespace separates arguments except inside single or double quotes. Backslash escapes the following character outside single quotes. Quote delimiters are removed, and unterminated quoted input MUST be rejected without executing the task.

#### 1.3.4. Presentation

Targets MUST remain distinguishable by workspace folder and Makefile when more than one scope exists. When at least one target in a Makefile has a category, categorized targets MUST be grouped by category and targets without a category MUST appear under **Uncategorized**.

The categories `Build`, `Test`, `Clean`, `Rebuild`, and `Rebuild All` MUST map case-insensitively to the corresponding built-in Visual Studio Code task group. Other category names remain presentation metadata.

A retained usage suffix MUST be shown in the target picker, explorer tooltip, generated task detail, and argument-input prompt. The description MUST remain visible in target-selection and task-detail surfaces, and the source location MUST remain available for navigation.

#### 1.3.5. Refresh and Error Handling

Initial discovery and manual refresh MUST be supported. Changes to `makefileTasks` configuration MUST trigger discovery refresh.

When `makefileTasks.autoRefresh` is enabled, saves to discovered Makefiles, workspace-folder changes, and file events matching `**/{Makefile,makefile,GNUmakefile,*.mk}` schedule a refresh. Files matched only by custom globs outside that watcher pattern MAY require manual refresh after external changes.

Discovery and input errors MUST be reported without terminating extension activation or executing invalid input.

### 1.4. Configuration

Configuration settings are grouped by the behavior they control.

#### 1.4.1. Discovery Configuration

| Setting                     | Default                                           | Purpose                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `makefileTasks.fileGlobs`   | `**/Makefile`, `**/makefile`, `**/GNUmakefile`    | Defines workspace-relative Makefile discovery patterns. |
| `makefileTasks.excludeGlob` | `**/{.git,node_modules,vendor,.venv,dist,out}/**` | Excludes matching paths from discovery.                 |

#### 1.4.2. Execution and Interaction Configuration

| Setting                     | Default | Purpose                                                       |
| --------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `makefileTasks.makeCommand` | `make`  | Defines the executable or command supplied to task execution. |
| `makefileTasks.runOnClick`  | `true`  | Runs a target when its explorer item is selected.             |

#### 1.4.3. Presentation and Refresh Configuration

| Setting                     | Default  | Purpose                                                               |
| --------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `makefileTasks.sort`        | `source` | Uses source order or name order in the explorer and task picker.      |
| `makefileTasks.autoRefresh` | `true`   | Enables refresh scheduling after supported workspace and file events. |

### 1.5. Examples

The examples demonstrate the recognized subset and its resulting metadata. Recipe behavior remains governed by GNU Make.

#### 1.5.1. Tasks

Example:

```make
## Build the application
build:
 go build ./...
```

The rule produces the target `build` with the description `Build the application`.

The equivalent inline form is:

```make
test: ## Run the test suite
 go test ./...
```

#### 1.5.2. Category

Example:

```make
# === Test ================================================================
## Run the test suite
test:
 go test ./...
```

The category `Test` applies to the target and maps it to the built-in test task group.

#### 1.5.3. Inputs

Example:

```make
# Usage: make secrets-decrypt <files> [ENV=<name>]
#
## Decrypt one or more files
secrets-decrypt:
 @echo "implementation omitted"
```

The usage suffix `<files> [ENV=<name>]` is descriptive. It is displayed by the extension but does not validate supplied values.

An explicit task supplies ordered runtime arguments independently of the usage annotation:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "type": "makefileTarget",
      "target": "secrets-decrypt",
      "makefile": "Makefile",
      "args": [
        "secrets/example.yaml.enc",
        "ENV=development"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The resulting Make invocation places both arguments after `secrets-decrypt`.

#### 1.5.4. Multiple Targets

Example:

```make
## Build both variants.
## Produce release artifacts.
alpha beta:: prerequisites
```

The rule produces `alpha` and `beta` with the description `Build both variants. Produce release artifacts.`

#### 1.5.5. Excluded Constructs

Example:

```make
## Pattern rules are excluded
build-%:

## Assignments are excluded
VALUE := example

undocumented:
 @echo hidden
```

None of these constructs produces a discovered target.

## 2. Terminology

- Active Category
  > The most recent valid category header that applies to subsequent documented targets.

- Description
  > Non-empty preceding or inline text that makes a supported target discoverable.

- Documented Target
  > A supported concrete target associated with a description.

- Pending Metadata
  > Description or usage metadata retained until the next supported rule or invalidated by unrelated input.

- Runtime Argument
  > One ordered value passed to Make after the selected target name.

- Usage Metadata
  > An optional annotation that describes expected input without supplying or validating it.

- Usage Suffix
  > The trimmed text following `make <target>` in a usage annotation.

- Workspace Scope
  > The Visual Studio Code workspace folder used to discover, distinguish, resolve, and execute a target.
